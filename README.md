## Why? 

The development of this project is carried out during my free time and during my studies, and was conceived after understanding the needs of a co-worker regarding the difficulties he has been facing in controlling the finances of his private bussiness. 

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

## Some Observations about this App 

**1 -** Despite not being part of my professional interest (UX/UI), I was extremely uncomfortable with the appearance of the standard TextBox of the .Net Framework together with the Flat Design chosen as User Interface.

[Textbox Padrão]() 

Therefore, I created a component called  [FlatTextBox](https://github.com/gianlucaborelli/ProjectVillaBeach/tree/main/ProjetoVillaBeach/Controles/FlatTextBoxControler) using the UserControl class, which makes aesthetic changes to the standard TextBox, and implements several other features, for example:

- Validation of data entered in the TextBox, according to the type of validation selected during system construction (such as C.P.F., C.N.P.J. and others).

- Validation if the component is mandatory.

In addition to other minor internal behaviors.
